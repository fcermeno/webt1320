            <h3> Family Traditions</h3>
            <img src="images/trad1.jpg" alt="trad1">
               <p>Venezuela remains a patriarchal society and its family traditions closely follow. Men are expected to be the bread winners, while women are expected to stay home and rear children. Family ties, including extended family ties, are important in Venezuela, evidenced by most members living in close proximity. Although these traditions and kinship ties are the cornerstone of society in Venezuela, you will find that they are much more relaxed in Caracas. Western influence has led to women working outside of the home, acquiring a college degree and breaking away from traditional gender roles.

<p>Caracas is Venezuela's hub of culture, and Christmas traditions there fall in with the prevailing beliefs of the country. Most Venezuelans are Catholic and celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25. 
In Caracas, and throughout the country, festivities begin on December 16 with the preparation of the Hallacas, a christmas food, and mass church services each morning. 
The final service, Misa de Aguinaldo or Misa de Gallo, occurs at midnight on Noche Buena, or Christmas Eve. Traditionally, Venezuelans erect a nativity scene, but Christmas trees also are very common. After a big family gathering and a traditional meal on Noche Buena.</p>
